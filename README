136 Dice game


Hey there, this is my first project ever so please be kind and indulgent :). This is a dice game invented by some of my friends.
Usually it is a drinking game and you'd play with real dice, but i'm trying to adapt it to a mobile app.

The goal of the game is to get 1-3-6 with the dice. You get two throws each turn and on your second throw you can choose how many dice you throw (1,2,3 or 0). 
If you don't get 1-3-6 then the player with the highest hand wins the round. 

The highest hand table looks like this:
- 6 6 6
- 4 5 6
- 5 5 5
- 3 4 5
- 4 4 4
- 2 3 4
- 3 3 3
- 1 2 3
- 2 2 2
- 1 1 1
- and then the pairs with the third dice being deliberating the winner if two players gets the same pairs.
- if no players have any pair or anything else on this table, the player with the highest dice wins.

If two players have the same hand, they go into sudden death. They both throw the dice only once and the player with the best hand wins.

As of V1.0, there are a few things that needs addressing: 
- I need to fix the algorithm that keeps track of the high score.
- Sudden death is not implemented
- No ability to choose the number of players and end the rounds.
- Design is horrible
- Design is not responsive to multiple screen size

My initial plan was to make this a multiplayer app, but I realized the challenge was a bit big for me. So MAYBE in the future in say.. V5.0 this will be multiplayer.

Thanks for reading me, I would appreciate any tips!

Tony.
